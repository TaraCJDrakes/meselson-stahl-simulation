# meselson-stahl-simulation
This interactive HTML-based simulation of the Meselson-Stahl experiment is designed for genetics and molecular biology students. This tool allows users to explore different DNA replication models (semiconservative, conservative, and dispersive) by simulating nitrogen isotope experiments and visualizing DNA separation based on weight.
